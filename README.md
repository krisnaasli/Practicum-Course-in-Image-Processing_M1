# PRACTICUM COURSE IN IMAGE PROCESSING MODUL 1
## Description
### There are 3 assignments from Module 1 of the Practicum in Image Processing which are 3 units in 1 project as follows:
#### * Practicum Practice 1 (Unit1.pas)
Practice 1 consists of one main window (Form1) that has two user interface (UI) components, namely TBitBtn (BitBtn1) and TLabel (Label1).
The purpose of this application is to change the text color of Label1 to green when the button (BitBtn1) is pressed. When the button is pressed, the BitBtn1Click event is triggered, and in the BitBtn1Click procedure, the text color of Label1 is changed to green (clGreen).
So, this application is a simple application that changes the Label1 text color to green when the button is pressed.
#### * Practical Exercise 2 (Unit2.pas)
In Practice 2, it consists of one main window (Form2) that has several user interface (UI) components, including TEdit (Edit1, Edit2, Edit3), TButton (Button1, Button2, Button3, Button4), and TLabel (Label1).
When the button (Button1) is clicked, the Button1Click event is triggered. In the Button1Click procedure, the values entered into Edit1 and Edit2 are retrieved (using strtoint to convert a string to an integer), then the two numbers are summed. The result is then displayed in Edit3 (using inttostr to convert integer to string).
So, this application is a simple application that calculates the sum of two numbers entered into two text boxes (Edit1 and Edit2) and displays the result in another text box (Edit3) when the button is pressed.
#### * Post Test (Unit3.pas)
The application consists of one main window (Form3) that has several user interface (UI) components, including a TRadioGroup (RadioGroup1), several TRadioButtons (RadioButton1, RadioButton2, RadioButton3, RadioButton4, RadioButton5), a TLabel (Label1), and a TButton (Button1).
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to select the text color of Label1 using radio buttons. When the user clicks on one of the radio buttons, the selected color is stored in the SelectedColor variable. When the button (Button1) is pressed, the Button1Click event is triggered, and the text color of Label1 is changed according to the color that has been selected from the radio button.
So, this application is a simple application that allows the user to select the color of the Label1 text using radio buttons and change the color of that text when the button is pressed.
